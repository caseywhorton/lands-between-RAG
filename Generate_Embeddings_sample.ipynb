      "Vector ID: 1j4qn6d-comment-1, Full Text: Im currently doing Faith / Str, my really first one, and im having some fun with that. I have mainly Holy dmg weapon ( Ordovisis’s Greatsword ) , i have Fire dmg weapon ( Cross-Naginata with Flame Strike ) when needed and sometimes when i need to use Incatations i use Lightning Strike / Frenzy Burts ( beem, broke af ). Maybe not so common or OP than those bleed / Str / Dex builds, but still easy to play and progress. Also with 50 Faith / 50-60 Str you get access to almoust everything and deal impressive dmg ( some Indications needs 60-70 Faith but there are only like 5 of them or so and they are not even that good ). With those stats im aiming 60 Vigor, 20-25 Mind and 25-30 Endurance and Dex for weapon. Int is not so must to have, there is one Shield buff spell ( needs like ~10 Int ) what can be handy and Arcane can be base or if you want to use Dragon Spells ( which actually are OP ) you can add Arcane to 12 or 16 depending what you are planning to use, but as example Theodorix Magma, Dragonice and Dragonmaw are S-Tier stuff and worth to invest. If you want ”cake-walk” you can just 2handed Blasphemous Blade and use ” Taker’s Flame ” ability, personally im not doing that because it destroys all fun from this game but it’s just my opinion. If you want ” burn them all ” then Magma Wyrm’s Scalesword is way to go, not so hard to get and that skill what it have is actually damn cool and easy to use. Swinging to sword itself is not maybe best way but still working. Also if you are lucky and get 2 x Magma Blades you can build some cool build around those, works with one weapon too, but with two you can do some cool jump attacks with ” Magma Shower ” skill. So yeah, if you don’t want do those Dex/Str/Bleed blaa blaa builds test out Faith. You can also do playthrough with Indications only i think ( 80 Faith ), learn to use Catch Flame and you can just roll-on battle and make some ” crispy balls ” 😂 Later you get access to Ancient Dragon Lighning Stike / Lightning Strike / Discus of Light ( not joking.. ) / Burn O Flame / Frenzied Burts ( best for sniping ) and if you have DLC Knight’s Lightning Spear and Rotten Butterflies. Some self-buffs to have are Golden Vow and Howl of Shabriri and for healing Erdtree Heal. Ofc there are more but those just came to my mind quickly.\n",

      "Vector ID: 1izvqoe-comment-1, Full Text: Want to melt bosses, go dex/arc. Want to trade over hits, play str/fth. Ofc all builds can do great damage, bleed is simple and easy, str/fth allows for easy heals and buffs. I like Siluria’s Greattree for str. Paired with golden vow, erdree’s blessing, bestial vitality, defensive talismans and physic buffs you can outtrade (almost) anything.\n",
      "As for dex any pair of katanas, curved swords or spears work well for me. Blood flame blade, and dragon communion spells are staples for me as well.\n",
      "Vector ID: 1izvqoe-comment-2, Full Text: You are my favorite kind of person to reply to. I like to define builds by their offensive tools at your stage of the game, so I'll list out some really potent options you can get early. Offensive tools are usually supported by one, sometimes two damage stats (strength, dexterity, faith, intelligence, and arcane), which you can see from the weapon's scaling. Generally, the game rewards investing in one damage stat until level 125-150 when you can begin to do near-optimal damage with multiple stats. The major exception to this is faith, which is often splashed for regen and buff spells. Now, pick one of the following weapons (or something else), then we'll go over stat allocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bloodhound's Fang - This is probably the most popular starter weapon. It's incredibly powerful without feeling overpowered and is aquired from a fairly easy fight in Limgrave.\n",
      "\n",
      "UchiKatana/Nagakiba - The samurai swords are quite good. They have a unique Ash of War - Unsheathe, and the heavy version does 40 stance damage, which will stagger a lot of bosses very quickly. They have a good and varried moveset with pokes and slashes and intrinsic bleed. Nagakiba is a mid-game quest reward that is almost a direct upgrade to the Uchikatana. You may see the Moonveil floating around. That's a magic katana that's very powerful but...I have a personal vendetta against it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greatsword/Zweihander - The Greatsword (actually a collosal sword) is probably the second most popular weapon from the early game. It's big, it's chunky. I prefer Zweihander for the R2, lower weight, and lower stat requirements, but it does have lower damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claymore - An actual greatsword and one of my favorite weapons in the game. It's simple. It's balanced. It's 2-handed moveset is amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guardian's Swordspear - This weapon needs to be farmed, so I'm a bit reluctant to recommend it, but the moveset is quite good. Similar to the Claymore, just a halberd instead of a greatsword.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rusted Anchor - This weapon does pierce damage, which is particularly powerful against armored enemies. Solid, balanced, basic moveset.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are A LOT more options, and basically anything is viable, but if you want to go strength or dex and use weapons to smack things, these are going to be a solid batch to choose from. I'm not into offensive magic, so maybe someone else can help if you want to go that route. If you reply and tell me your level, starting class, and choose a weapon, I can put together a stat spread for you (assuming you've unlocked the ability to re-spec). I'll make at least one more comment going over some other stuff.\n",
      "Vector ID: 1izvqoe-comment-3, Full Text: **Stats**\n",
      "\n",
      "The scaling on a weapon loosely tells you how much your stats will contribute to damage, and that scaling increases as the weapon gets higher level. This means that for the early game, your offensive stats aren't actually that impactful to your damage, and weapon level is MUCH more important. Conversely, the vigor stat boosts your HP a lot until you get 40 vigor, and the survivability bonus from that is incredible. For that reason, my broad leveling gameplan over a playthrough is this:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Get minimum stats for whatever weapon I want and enough endurance to medium roll\n",
      "2. Get 40 vigor\n",
      "3. Get 11 faith for bestial vitality\n",
      "4. level damage stat to 30-40\n",
      "5. Get vigor to 60\n",
      "6. Max main damage stat (generally 80, 2-handing with strength maxes at 54)\n",
      "7. Somewhere in there, get endurance to 25-40 and mind to 15-20, faith as desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main faith buffs are bestial vitality/other regen (11 faith), flame grant me strength (15 faith), and golden vow (25 faith). Vigor to 60 is the most common advice on the subreddit, but it's not strictly necessary if you want to focus more on damage. If you are struggling to learn boss movesets, more HP just gives you more time to learn, and I highly recommend it.\n",

      "**Ashes of War/Infusions**\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two categories of weapons: somber, and smithing. They upgrade differently, and smithing weapons have access to this system that changes their damage, scaling, and skill (called an ash of war). Somber weapons are static. Most smithing weapons work fine on most infusions, but are optimal on one or two. I wouldn't stress too hard about it, just pick an infusion that matches your damage stats. By default, ashes of war are limited in what infusions they can work with, but you can expand these options with different whetblades, which are key items you can find around the game. Here are some of the strongest Ashes of War and roughly their utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stormblade - This thing is one of the best ranged spells in the game and you get more damage by just leveling up your weapon. I cannot express how good this thing is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sacred Blade - After you shoot the holy blade, your weapon is buffed with holy damage and will kill skeletons without you having to 2-hit them. This skill is great even with 0 faith, so don't be afraid to throw it on at the grace at the start of an undead dungeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lion's Claw - This is a trading machine. It does A LOT of damage, poise damage, has crazy hyper armor, and is cool AF. This is a classic on the Greatsword I mentioned in my other comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stormcaller - This is a big multi-hit AOE around your character. I like this on weapons that struggle to hit multiple enemies, and anything that adds a status, as the multiple hits will build it up quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impaling Thrust/Piercing Fang - The opposite of stormcaller, these do a lot of damage and poise damage to a single target. I like them on weapons that have big, sweeping movesets.\n",

      "By the way, Charge Forth is really good with bloodflame blade--since BFB ignores status motion values, every tiny hit builds up blood loss.\n",
      "Vector ID: 1izpq3d-comment-1, Full Text: I like stamp sweep, stamp upward cut, Earthshaker, waves of darkness, golden land, and the native ash charge forth is good too but you can’t put an affinity on it :(\n",
